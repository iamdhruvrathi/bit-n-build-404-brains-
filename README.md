## Problem Statement & Solution
### Smart Wardrobe Management System (SWMS)

A first-year engineering student is determined to address team formation and communication gaps related to college events. His comprehensive platform will feature:

- **Wardrobe on Web:** Develop a user-friendly web platform where users can create a digital representation of their wardrobe, easily accessible from any device.
- **Adding and Deleting Clothes:** Allow users to seamlessly add new items or remove old ones from their virtual wardrobe through simple forms or uploading images, ensuring their collection is always up-to-date.
- **Usage Analytics Dashboard:** Provide an analytics dashboard that tracks and displays statistics on the frequency of wear for each item, helping users identify which clothes are underutilized and which are their favorites.
- **Community Exchange Page:** Create a dedicated space for users to connect with others for swapping or donating clothes, fostering a sense of community while promoting sustainability.
- **User Account Management:** Implement a secure login and signup feature to support multiple accounts, enabling different users to manage their wardrobes individually while maintaining privacy and personal data security.
- **Outfit Creation Tool:** Include a feature that allows users to mix and match items to create outfits, enhancing the process of getting dressed while maximizing the use of their existing clothing.

  
The aim is to promote student engagement, facilitate collaboration, and enhance the college experience.
